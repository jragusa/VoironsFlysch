# VoironsFlysch

Dataset of the Voirons Flysch (Chablais Prealps, Haute-Savoie, France)

## Geological settings

The Alps are surrounding by several moderate elevated reliefs made of sedimentary covers and usually called *Prealps* by geographers. This term is restrained in geology to two reliefs spreaded between the Geneva Lake (France) and the Thune Lake (Switzerland). They are constituted by a stack of Tethyan sedimentary covers (Trias to Eocene) from the southern margin (Upper Prealpine nappes) to the northern margin (Ultrahelvetic nappe).
The Gurnigel nappe outcrops in the external edge, in lower position. It comprises several flysch units as much tectonic unit. The Voirons Flysch is the westernward unit, located at c.a. 20 km to Geneva. It is subdivided into four stratigraphic units: the Voirons Sandstone Fm. (VS), the Vouan Conglomerate Fm. (VC), the Boëge Marl Fm. (BM) and the Bruant Sandstone Fm. (BS).

The paleogeography of the Gurnigel nappe stills debated. The usual interpretation describes it as South Penninic (Caron, 1976 ; Winkler, 1984). However, recent biostratigrapic studies focusing on planktonic foraminifers (Ospina-Ostios et al., 2013) indicate a North Penninic affiliation, such as the Valais domain (Trümpy, 2006).

These dataset composes the PhD thesis focusing on the petrography, the stratigraphy and the provenance of the Voirons Flysch (Ragusa, 2015).

## Data

+ *HeavyMinerals.csv*: Heavy mineral populations using the QEMSCAN at the University of Geneva (Departement of Earth Sciences).
+ *ModalComposition.csv*: Dataset of the modal composition following the Gazzi-Dickinson model (Gazzi et al, 1973 ; Dickinson et al., 1979 ; Dickinson et al., 1983). Countings include extrabasinal, intrabasinal grains, porosity and overall cementation (Zuffa, 1980). Keys of columns are included in preambule as comment.
+ *outcrops*: GPS location of outcrops with stratigraphic affiliation. Dataset is available in csv, gpx and geojson files.
+ *StratigraphicColours.gpl*: reference colours of the Voirons Flysch stratigraphy for Gimp and Inkscape.
+ *StratigraphicLog.csv*: Bed thickness measurements of the studied outcrops
+ *tectonic.csv*: dip and azimut measurements of bed and faults.
