# VoironsFlysch

Dataset of the Voirons Flysch (Chablais Prealps, Haute-Savoie, France)

## Geological settings

The Alps are surrounding by several moderate elevated reliefs made of sedimentary covers and usually called *Prealps* by geographers comprising the Chablais Prealps and the Swiss Prealps in between the Geneva Lake (France) and the Thune Lake (Switzerland). They are constituted by a stack of Tethyan sedimentary covers (Triassic to Eocene) from the southern margin (Upper Prealpine nappes) to the northern margin (Ultrahelvetic nappe).
The Gurnigel nappe outcrops in the external edge, in lower position. It comprises several flysch units identified as single tectonic unit. The Voirons Flysch is the westernward unit, located at c.a. 20 km to Geneva. It is subdivided into four stratigraphic units: the Voirons Sandstone Fm. (VS), the Vouan Conglomerate Fm. (VC), the Boëge Marl Fm. (BM) and the Bruant Sandstone Fm. (BS).

The palaeogeography of the Gurnigel nappe stills debated. The usual interpretation suggests an Maastrichtian to Middle Eocene describing a South Penninic origin (Caron, 1976; Winkler, 1984). However, recent biostratigrapic studies focusing on planktonic foraminifers (Ospina-Ostios et al., 2013; Ospina-Ostios, 2017) rejuvenated the Voirons Flysch and indicate a North Penninic origin, in the Valais domain (Trümpy, 2006).

## Dataset

The dataset composes the PhD thesis focusing on the petrography, the stratigraphy and the provenance of the Voirons Flysch (Ragusa, 2015).
