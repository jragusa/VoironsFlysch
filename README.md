# VoironsFlysch

Dataset of the Voirons Flysch (Chablais Prealps, Haute-Savoie, France)

## Geological settings

The Alps are surrounding by several moderate reliefs made of sedimentary covers and usually called *Prealps* by geographers. This term is restrained in geology to two reliefs located between the Geneva Lake (France) and the Thune Lake (Switzerland). They are characterized by a stack of tethyan sedimentary covers from the southern margin (Upper Prealpine nappes) to the northern margin (Ultrahelvetic realm).
The Gurnigel nappe is located in the external edge on lower position. It is subdivided into several flysches. The Voirons Flysch is the westernward unit, c.a. 20 km to Geneva.

The paleogeography of the Gurnigel nappe stills debated. The usual interpretation describes it as South Penninic (Caron, 1976 ; Winkler, 1984). However, recent biostratigrapic studies (Ospina-Ostios et al., 2013) indicate a North Penninic affiliation, such as the Valais domain (Tr√ºmpy, 2006).

These dataset composes the PhD thesis focusing on petrography, stratigraphy and provenance of the Voirons Flysch (Ragusa, 2015).

## Data

Dataset of the modal composition following the Gazzi-Dickinson model (Gazzi et al, 1973 ; Dickinson et al., 1979 ; Dickinson et al., 1983). Countings include extrabasinal, intrabasinal grains, porosity and overall cementation (Zuffa, 1980). Keys of columns are included in preambule as comment.
