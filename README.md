# VoironsFlysch

Dataset of the Voirons Flysch (Chablais Prealps, Haute-Savoie, France)

## Geological settings

The Alps are surrounding by several moderate reliefs made of sedimentary covers and usually called *Prealps* by geographers. This term is restrained in geology to two reliefs spreaded between the Geneva Lake (France) and the Thune Lake (Switzerland). They are constituted by a stack of tethyan sedimentary covers from the southern margin (Upper Prealpine nappes) to the northern margin (Ultrahelvetic realm).
The Gurnigel nappe is located in the external edge, in lower position. It is subdivided into several flysch units. The Voirons Flysch is the westernward unit, at c.a. 20 km to Geneva.

The paleogeography of the Gurnigel nappe stills debated. The usual interpretation describes it as South Penninic (Caron, 1976 ; Winkler, 1984). However, recent biostratigrapic studies (Ospina-Ostios et al., 2013) indicate a North Penninic affiliation, such as the Valais domain (Tr√ºmpy, 2006).

These dataset composes the PhD thesis focusing on petrography, stratigraphy and provenance of the Voirons Flysch (Ragusa, 2015).

## Data

* HeavyMinerals.csv: Heavy mineral populations using the QEMSCAN at the University of Geneva (Departement of Earth Sciences).
* ModalComposition.csv: Dataset of the modal composition following the Gazzi-Dickinson model (Gazzi et al, 1973 ; Dickinson et al., 1979 ; Dickinson et al., 1983). Countings include extrabasinal, intrabasinal grains, porosity and overall cementation (Zuffa, 1980). Keys of columns are included in preambule as comment.
* outcrops: GPS location of outcrops with stratigraphic affiliation. Dataset is available in csv, gpx and geojson files.
* StratigraphicLog.csv: Bed thickness measurements of the studied outcrops
* tectonic.csv: dip and azimut measurements of bed and faults.
